# structuredauthoring
Output of my DITA project using structured authoring from Oxygen 

This site was published as a project I did for WRIT 4662W "Writing with Digital Technologies".

This output was generated by Oxygen XML using the "webhelp responsive" output. I have made modifications to the style of the website using Oxygen Styles Basket. 

This is an original project written by me, Corey Wales, and was made in an educational setting. I used material from Fangraphs as inspiration for my project and have used images from their website as part of my project.
